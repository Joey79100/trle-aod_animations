A CANCELLED continuation of Tomb Raider the Angel of Darkness.

Authors:
Caesum, Dale, Krystian, Joey, Adam Khuverr, thomaskobialka, Mrshina, Lore, AODFan, tomblover, LevelNextGen and probably an entire lot of other people who worked on it from time to time.

WARNING: Some prj2 files were made with Tomb Editor version that was not released yet (28.07.2019). Because of that I strongly suggest to wait until next TE release (probably in august 2019) before editing any levels or wad2 files.

TERMS OF USE:
You can take anything you like from this project for as long as you credit the people mentioned above. Also, if you use some existing setup from the game and improve it, then: please share, don't keep it to yourself. Since we shared our setups and assets and it's your basis, it's only fair that you share your version with other people as well.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD:
The recommended way to download the files is to use a GitHuB Desktop application. You can download it here:
https://desktop.github.com/

If you can't download the application or any of its alternatives (there are many), you might want to try downloading files through the browser.
However, it is known that downloading files from the browser tends to change *.WAS and *.SAM files' end of lines from CRLF (Windows format) to LF (Unix format). This does not corrupt the files themselves, but makes it impossible to open them in WADMerger without additional steps. For that you have to open each and every *.was and *.sam file in Notepad++, then go to Edit menu > Convert End of lines > Convert to Windows (CRLF) and save. This is not the recommended way.
