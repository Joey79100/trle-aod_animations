   -- Footsteps sounds ressource pack --
===========================================

***************** UPDATE! *****************
The sounds looked like they were converted
 correctly but they didn't work in-game.
   (they were converted with Audacity)
 I re-converted them with the TRNG's Audio
converter, and they should work correctly.

/!\ - It's a ressource pack! - /!\
This is not a copy-paste-play pack: it's not ready to use!

These sounds are meant to be used IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THEM. If you don't know how
to use the sounds in TRLE or you're not sure, then don't use them. I've made another
pack with a lot less sounds but they are ready to use.

-------- Notes --------

I don't own them, I just converted them so they're already to the right format.
There's a file in this pack for you with lines meant to replace the ones you don't
use in your game, with already specified volume. 

I recommend you to use these sounds alone, especially for the marble sound. What I
mean is to remove the default soundsteps sounds in WadMerger to replace them with only
the footsteps PlayEffect (when in land of course). This way you will really have only
the footsteps where Lara is walking and no more stone + footstep.
But that's a long work because there are maaany animations where you would have to
do this. But if you think it sounds good the normal way, then it's up to you. :)

Enjoy! :)
