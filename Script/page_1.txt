#TITLE#=The Dark Renaissance
<END_FORMAT>
Centuries ago, in the darkest age of European history, dread alchemist Pieter van Eckhardt forged an alchemical conduit known as the Blood Sign. Intended as a tool in aiding him in resurrecting a lineage of fallen angels known as the Nephilim.
Just last year, Eckhardt was on the cusp of resuscitating such a remnant, known as the Sleeper, until I subjugated him with my companion, a Lux Veritatis neonate by the name of Kurtis Trent, who has seemingly gone missing.

Months later, following my redemption in the eyes of the French authorities, I found myself on a familiar trail as more grisly murders, like the one that took my friend and mentor Werner Von Croy away from me, are being reported in the Bavarian Alps of Germany.
I suspect the Cabal may still be at large without their depraved master Eckhardt, and so I set off to investigate, and to my surprise, the sentient Chirugai - an heirlook of Kurtis' lineage, responded to my conviction.
